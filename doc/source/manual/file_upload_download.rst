File Upload and Download
========================

The Materials Commons API supports uploading files. If you have a large number of files, or individual files that are
bigger than 250MB it is recommended that you use Globus to perform your uploads and downloads. Showing how to use the
Globus API is outside the scope of this documentation. ::
