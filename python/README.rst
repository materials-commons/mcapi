API for MaterialsCommons.org
============================

This is the python version of an API to MaterialsCommons.org. The source
code is available at
https://github.com/materials-commons/mcapi/tree/master/python.

It consists of four packages/modules: \* **mcapi** - the main interface
to the API \* **mcapi.cli** - a command line interface (see scripts/mc)
\* **demo\_project** - a module for building a demo project in a
designated Materials Commons server, for a given user, using the API

In addition there is a distribution package (which includes the
demo\_project and mcapi moduels): **mcapi\_dist**.

For testing: see **test/RunTests.md**
